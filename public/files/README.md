This folder is for your downloadable documents, such as your **resume** and **portfolio PDFs**.

### How to use

1. Export your resume as a PDF and save it here as, for example:
   - `sumanta-mandar-resume.pdf`
2. Export your portfolio as a PDF and save it here as, for example:
   - `sumanta-mandar-portfolio.pdf`

After adding the files, you can link to them from your React components using paths like:

- `/files/sumanta-mandar-resume.pdf`
- `/files/sumanta-mandar-portfolio.pdf`

These files will be served statically by the app when you build or run the development server.
